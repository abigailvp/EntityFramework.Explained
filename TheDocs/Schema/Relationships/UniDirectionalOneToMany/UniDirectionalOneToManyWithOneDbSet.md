# Uni Directional One To Many With One Db Set
Because the entity used in the `DbSet` has a collection of another entity type, the latter are mapped as well.  
EF infers and includes related entities in the schema even when only one side is explicitly registered in the `DbContext`.  

When using the following simple model of *one* `Blog` containing *many* `Posts`: 
```csharp
public class Blog
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
}
```
```csharp
public class Post
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public Blog Blog { get; set; } = default!;
}
```
And then adding a `DbSet<Blog>` to the `DbContext` EF generates the following ddl for Sql Server:  

**Blog:**
```csharp
    [
        "CREATE TABLE [Blog] (",
        "    [Id] int NOT NULL IDENTITY,",
        "    CONSTRAINT [PK_Blog] PRIMARY KEY ([Id])",
        ");"
    ];
```
**Post:**
```csharp
    [
        "CREATE TABLE [Posts] (",
        "    [Id] int NOT NULL IDENTITY,",
        "    [BlogId] int NOT NULL,",
        "    CONSTRAINT [PK_Posts] PRIMARY KEY ([Id]),",
        "    CONSTRAINT [FK_Posts_Blog_BlogId] FOREIGN KEY ([BlogId]) REFERENCES [Blog] ([Id]) ON DELETE CASCADE",
        ");"
    ];
```
**Index:**
```csharp
 "CREATE INDEX [IX_Posts_BlogId] ON [Posts] ([BlogId]);";
```
*Note:* No other mappings were added.
